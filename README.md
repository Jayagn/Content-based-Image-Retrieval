# Content-based-Image-Retrieval

CBIR follows basic following steps

- Getting the Dataset (referenceImages)
- Extracting features from those reference images
- Get the query image (queryImage dataset) and extracts its features same way as of reference images
- Calculate similarity between extracted features of each reference image and given query image
- Display the most similar image, that is image having least distance between features
